# The Room Game:

I participated in a course for Object Oriented Programming in Python. This is the code i came up with after the course. It is a text game of three rooms: kitchen, dining hall and ballroom. In this game there is a Room class, Character class. There are also Enemy and Friend classes which are subclasses of the Character class. john object is an enemy, while tom is a friend object. There can be movement from one room to another only in certain specific direction. dictionary, loops, getters and setters are used in the program.
